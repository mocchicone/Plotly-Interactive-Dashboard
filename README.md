# **Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard Using Javascript and Plotly**

Using D3, Plotly, and JavaScript, created an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset from [NC State, The Public Science Lab](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
